This repository contains a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) designed to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of 10 different clothing categories (e.g., T-shirts, trousers, dresses). The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras, featuring multiple convolutional and pooling layers followed by dense layers for classification
